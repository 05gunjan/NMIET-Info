      We, at NMIET try to connect with as many companies as possible for placement of students. We enjoy the advantage of<br /> getting cream layer of students at our institutes. Our Alumni are also performing well in the industries where they are<br /> placed. Hence we could get the recognition from industries. We believe that the backbone of our T&P Cell is our student<br /> volunteers of T&P Cell who work very hard with full enthusiasm to conduct the recruitment drives smoothly. All these<br /> volunteers develop their management skills, interpersonal skills and above all Leadership skills. All such student volunteers<br /> become Managers/ Project leaders earlier in their career as compared to their other counterpartsbecause of these skills. We<br /> would like to assure Industry, Studentsand Parents that we will not leave any stone unturned to make all our stakeholders<br /> Happy and Proud.</p>
